# Pencil-Durability-Kata
Steps to building and running this program:
1.  Open your command line program
2.  Navigate to this repository (this will be the directory with msbuild.exe in it)
3.  Run the command "msbuild pencilkata\pencilkata\pencilkata.csproj" (without the quotation marks)
      This builds the project
4.  Run the command "pencilkata\pencilkata\bin\debug\pencilkata.exe" (without the quotation marks)
      This runs the program
      
The program runs the tests located in the penciltests.cs file and does not have any actual interaction since this kata was for a class library.
